# Zipf's Law
Zipf's law is an unusual phenomenon that crops up when the frequency of words in any given text are put in descending order against their "rank" (most common word has a rank = 1). What you see, within a certain amount of error, is that the second most common word comes up about $\frac{1}{2}$ as many times as the most common word, the third common word comes up $\frac{1}{3}$ as many times as the most common word etc... Zipf's law is a power law and is the basis for the pareto principle (eg 20% of your code will be the source of 80% of your bugs). The code in this repo graphs the frequency vs rank of the words contained within all the Sherlock Holmes books.
